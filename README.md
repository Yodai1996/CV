This is a directory for Computer Vision.
Details of what I implemented are below:


(1) Supervised Segmentation of Medical Images. 
   
I used the data of MRI images of hearts (256*256 sizes) and the segmented data of the same sizes.

The number of the data is just 282, but the scores such as Pixcel Accurecy and Intersection over Union are quite high, 
using the architecture of Fully Convolutional Network or U_Net
